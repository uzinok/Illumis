				<p>In&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the episodes, a&nbsp;girl came to&nbsp;the investors&rsquo; studio and tried to&nbsp;convince businessmen to&nbsp;invest in&nbsp;a&nbsp;remedy for PMS. In&nbsp;her presentation, the girl talked not only about the fact that pain, depressive mood and increased appetite come to&nbsp;99&nbsp;out of&nbsp;100 women during PMS, but she also mentioned that scientists had been trying for years to&nbsp;create a&nbsp;working drug for PMS. A&nbsp;young specialist, she managed to&nbsp;develop a&nbsp;remedy that works. Several investors made up&nbsp;their mind to&nbsp;invest in&nbsp;the project. Dragons&rsquo; Den What Happened Next featuring the young scientist will be&nbsp;released shortly. <b>And now we&nbsp;would like to&nbsp;tell you what kind of&nbsp;product it&nbsp;is, how it&nbsp;works and why several multi millionaires became interested in&nbsp;its production.</b></p>
				<div id="web_aside" class="web_aside"></div>
				<p>Stacy James is&nbsp;a&nbsp;young professional with firsthand knowledge of&nbsp;PMS symptoms. While studying at&nbsp;the Medical University, she often took part in&nbsp;scientific conferences. After one of&nbsp;the conferences, she began to&nbsp;actively study natural ingredients that do&nbsp;not disrupt the hormonal background, but relieve the symptoms of&nbsp;premenstrual syndrome. She managed to&nbsp;find out an&nbsp;unusual fact and she is&nbsp;going to&nbsp;tell you about it&nbsp;right now.</p>

				<p><b><i>&mdash;&nbsp;Hello! Thank you for coming to&nbsp;our studio. But why PMS? Could you explain?</i></b></p>
				<p>&mdash;&nbsp;Hello, thanks for the invitation. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;gynecologist and, first of&nbsp;all, a&nbsp;girl, I&nbsp;know that PMS symptoms bother every woman. In&nbsp;some people, this syndrome is&nbsp;less pronounced, but it&nbsp;brings discomfort one way or&nbsp;another. Personally, I&nbsp;was less fortunate and my&nbsp;premenstrual syndrome is&nbsp;very bright. Pain in&nbsp;my&nbsp;stomach, back, chest and head, my&nbsp;entire body hurts. In&nbsp;addition, I&nbsp;experience digestive problems, my&nbsp;face is&nbsp;covered with acne and&nbsp;I become very irritable, and such symptoms haunt most women and it&nbsp;is&nbsp;impossible to&nbsp;get rid of&nbsp;them with medication, diet or&nbsp;sports. We&nbsp;have to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;school, to&nbsp;work, to&nbsp;be&nbsp;mothers and wives. Most women in&nbsp;this situation cannot afford to&nbsp;rest for a&nbsp;few days, which can lead to&nbsp;a&nbsp;nervous breakdown, depression, and the development of&nbsp;gynecological diseases and hormonal disruptions.</p>
				<p><b><i>&mdash;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s terrible, but why does the body behave like this at&nbsp;this time?</i></b></p>
				<p>&mdash;&nbsp;Before the periods, hormones are rearranged, which is&nbsp;reflected in&nbsp;the body. The stronger the PMS symptoms, the harder the periods. They become painful, unstable, too short&nbsp;or, on&nbsp;the contrary, long.</p>
				<p>Many people think that severe PMS symptoms appear due to&nbsp;gynecological disorders, such as&nbsp;polyps or&nbsp;endometriosis, or&nbsp;vitamin deficiencies (iron). But that&rsquo;s not always the case. In&nbsp;95% of&nbsp;cases, problems develop precisely due to&nbsp;difficult PMS.</p>
				<p><b><i>&mdash;&nbsp;It&nbsp;turns out that you know firsthand what PMS is&nbsp;and therefore decided to&nbsp;help yourself and other women. So&nbsp;how did you manage to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it?</i></b></p>
				<p>&mdash;&nbsp;I&nbsp;went to&nbsp;medical university because&nbsp;I suffered from premenstrual syndrome all my&nbsp;life. I&nbsp;have tried all kinds of&nbsp;remedies, but none have been effective. While studying, I&nbsp;attended medical conferences and forums. At&nbsp;one of&nbsp;them, I&nbsp;managed to&nbsp;sign up&nbsp;for an&nbsp;internship with a&nbsp;very reputable doctor who, in&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;everything, was engaged in&nbsp;scientific activities. He&nbsp;then told me&nbsp;about the benefits of&nbsp;CBD, which can relieve pain and spasms, increase concentration, reduce inflammation, relax muscles and have a&nbsp;calming effect. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;actively used in&nbsp;medicine, there are even similar remedies for PMS, but all of&nbsp;them are not effective and safe enough. That&rsquo;s why&nbsp;I decided to&nbsp;make my&nbsp;own. Of&nbsp;course, I&nbsp;spent a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;money and time before creating the ultimate Illumis formula. Though it&nbsp;was already different from other products, it&nbsp;was not yet ideal.</p>
				<figure>
					<img src="./img/img-2.jpg" alt="#" width="656" height="528" loading="lazy">

				</figure>
				<p><b><i>&mdash;&nbsp;Is&nbsp;that why you came to&nbsp;Dragons&rsquo; Den?</i></b></p>
				<p>&mdash;&nbsp;Right. In&nbsp;addition, I&nbsp;managed to&nbsp;win their favor and in&nbsp;the end&nbsp;I received a&nbsp;decent amount of&nbsp;money for research and development. I&nbsp;am very grateful to&nbsp;have been chosen. This money helped me&nbsp;continue my&nbsp;research, hire specialists, refine the formula, conduct tests, and launch production.</p>
				<p><b><i>&mdash;&nbsp;Could you tell&nbsp;us more about the formula of&nbsp;the drug? How does it&nbsp;work? Can it&nbsp;bring the same effect as&nbsp;THC, for example?</i></b></p>
				<p>&mdash;&nbsp;I&rsquo;m going to&nbsp;tell you about the main ingredients, but&nbsp;I will say right away that this is&nbsp;a&nbsp;natural and safe product that is&nbsp;fundamentally different from THC and does not give the same effect.</p>
				<p>The two main ingredients are CBD and CBG.</p>
				<p>CBD is&nbsp;a&nbsp;cannabidiol that does not have an&nbsp;intoxicating compound and is&nbsp;synthesized from Cannabis sativa. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;known for its powerful healing and therapeutic properties. CBD acts on&nbsp;the muscles to&nbsp;relax them, relieve spasms, and reduce pain and inflammation. At&nbsp;the same time, it&nbsp;increases concentration. You do&nbsp;not feel very relaxed, but rather collected and calm at&nbsp;the same time. That&nbsp;is, this plant does not increase the heart rate, does not disturb the heart rhythm and does not allow the nervous system to&nbsp;be&nbsp;excited.</p>
				<p>Cannabigerol, or&nbsp;CBG, is&nbsp;also found in&nbsp;the Cannabis sativa plant. It&nbsp;was discovered later than CBD. This is&nbsp;due to&nbsp;the fact that its content in&nbsp;the plant is&nbsp;not that high and its extraction is&nbsp;a&nbsp;much more difficult and expensive procedure. I&nbsp;should admit that most of&nbsp;the investments went to&nbsp;CBG. This is&nbsp;what sets Illumis apart from similar products. My&nbsp;formulation contains high levels of&nbsp;pure CBG. This particular ingredient has special healing properties. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;not only an&nbsp;antibacterial and antifungal agent, but also an&nbsp;excellent pain reliever, anti-inflammatory, and most importantly, a&nbsp;potential cancer inhibitor. It&nbsp;has many properties that no&nbsp;other product in&nbsp;the world can boast&nbsp;of. At&nbsp;the same time, CBG does not have an&nbsp;intoxicating effect on&nbsp;the body or&nbsp;brain. In&nbsp;addition, CBG helps to&nbsp;increase bone strength and relieve insomnia, which is&nbsp;very important for women over&nbsp;30, when the first problems appear, which can very quickly lead to&nbsp;serious consequences.</p>

				<p><b><i>&mdash;&nbsp;So&nbsp;your formula is&nbsp;completely safe? What else does it&nbsp;include?</i></b></p>
				<p>&mdash;&nbsp;Yes, Illumis is&nbsp;completely safe. This has been confirmed by&nbsp;tests carried out in&nbsp;independent laboratories. The product received certificates of&nbsp;analysis (COA). Medicinal properties of&nbsp;the drug have also been laboratory confirmed. The formula would not be&nbsp;as&nbsp;effective without additional natural ingredients, such as&nbsp;Vitex, which has been used for centuries to&nbsp;help with infertility problems and reduce PMS symptoms (headaches and irregular bleeding).</p>
				<p>Did you know that, for various reasons, the ratio of&nbsp;neurotransmitters in&nbsp;women changes, which affects the psycho-emotional state, mood, reproductive system and sexual behavior? It&nbsp;has been proven that 9&nbsp;out of&nbsp;10&nbsp;women have health problems due to&nbsp;this particular reason. Modern medicines are aimed at&nbsp;solving one specific problem, while not eliminating the real source of&nbsp;the disease. Illumis is&nbsp;designed for a&nbsp;comprehensive recovery of&nbsp;the female body. Its regular intake stabilizes the emotional state, eliminates problems in&nbsp;the intimate and reproductive areas.</p>

				<p><b><i>&mdash;&nbsp;Amazing. You have done a&nbsp;great job creating this solution. But I&nbsp;don&rsquo;t fully understand how it&nbsp;works.</i></b></p>
				<p>&mdash;&nbsp;Look, all people have an&nbsp;endocannabinoid system (ECS). This system is&nbsp;made up&nbsp;of&nbsp;cannabinoid receptors (CB₁ and CB₂) that interact with cannabinoids such as&nbsp;CBD and CBG. You will be&nbsp;surprised, but both of&nbsp;these receptors (CB₁ and CB₂) are expressed in&nbsp;the uterus, other vital organs, the nervous system, and bones. This is&nbsp;why CBD and CBG help with many issues related to&nbsp;seizures, hormonal imbalances, mood, stress/anxiety, inflammation, and more. At&nbsp;the same time, they make each other stronger, because CBD is&nbsp;more effective for the physical condition of&nbsp;the body, while CBG helps with stress, psycho-emotional disorders, depression and neurological disharmony. Additional natural ingredients also normalize the balance of&nbsp;female hormones in&nbsp;the body, regulate periods, relieve pain, and period cramps.</p>
				<p>In&nbsp;addition, Illumis:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Blocks inflammatory mediators;</li>
					<li>Increases the activity of&nbsp;the brain mediator GABA, which inhibits pain;</li>
					<li>Stimulates the production of&nbsp;serotonin&nbsp;&mdash; the &lsquo;happy hormone&rsquo;;</li>
					<li>Reduces pain impulses;</li>
					<li>Neutralizes pain signals sent to&nbsp;the brain;</li>
					<li>Reduces smooth muscle pulsation during spasms;</li>
					<li>Relieves nausea and vomiting, which often accompany severe pain;</li>
					<li>Softens the course of&nbsp;chronic pain due to&nbsp;arthritis, radiculitis, gastritis, migraine and other diseases;</li>
					<li>Prevents exacerbations of&nbsp;chronic diseases and their complications (including tumor formation).</li>
				</ul>

				<p><b><i>&mdash;&nbsp;No&nbsp;wonder your presentation won the hearts of&nbsp;investors and they helped you create this solution. But could you tell me&nbsp;where people can buy&nbsp;it?</i></b></p>
				<p>&mdash;&nbsp;Unfortunately, at&nbsp;the moment, Illumis is&nbsp;an&nbsp;exclusive product, so&nbsp;it&nbsp;is&nbsp;not yet sold in&nbsp;pharmacies. The first batch sold out within just a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;days. The second batch is&nbsp;currently ready and it&nbsp;can be&nbsp;purchased on&nbsp;the official website, which we&nbsp;have created specifically for customer convenience.
					You don&rsquo;t need a&nbsp;prescription from your doctor, as&nbsp;the product has no&nbsp;banned substances and is&nbsp;completely natural.</p>
				<p><b><i>&mdash;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s definitely a&nbsp;pleasure! Thank you for the interview, for your work and for trying to&nbsp;change the world for the better.</i></b></p>
				<p>&mdash;&nbsp;I&nbsp;have always stood for innovation and I&nbsp;am glad that&nbsp;I can move in&nbsp;the right direction. Hopefully, Illumis will help every woman, therefore I&nbsp;am giving a&nbsp;50% discount to&nbsp;whoever orders the product from the second batch.</p>

							<p>You know, everyone's body is different. My pain was so terrible that I could hardly get out of bed for three days, and 10 days before my periods I simply turned into a ball of nerves, I was irritated by EVERYTHING. Fortunately, I found out about Illumis, otherwise I don’t know how much longer I would have suffered. This is the only product that whipped me into shape, both internally and externally.</p>
